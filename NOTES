============================

CVS checkout commands (from http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/supported-platforms/):

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pcc.ludd.ltu.se:/cvsroot co pcc-libs
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pcc.ludd.ltu.se:/cvsroot co pcc

I have noticed at least once that 'cvs update' didn't get everything new
and that after moving the old copies out of the way and doing a fresh
checkout I got more stuff. That's weird, but maybe it's a factoid about
CVS that I've just forgotten.

In any case, it's probably a good idea to go through that exercise
every once in a while.
